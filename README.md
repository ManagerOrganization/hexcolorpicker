About
=====

The original Hex Color Picker was developed by Jesper with [Waffle Software][wf_url] you can grab it over on the [Project Page][hcp_url].

[wf_url]: http://wafflesoftware.net/
[hcp_url]: http://wafflesoftware.net/hexpicker/

The biggest use out of this plugin was the ability to grab the non-calibrated color from a mac. But I worked with a lot of different groups in the agency and need more values then just the Hex. So was always grabbing the hex and converting to RGP. That with my desire to learn a bit of Cocoa led my to modify this plugin a little.

This isn't the official repo for Hex Color Picker. I've contacted Jesper and he is still working on this and another project and didn't want to put this in Github, I wanted a way to store my changes and share it friends. I've contacted Jesper and have this on Github with his knowledge.

Known Issues
============

Easy fix or not, these are things I need to go back in and fix

- Typing in colors only accepts Hex and HTML Shorthand
- Update server still using waffle software's (not sure how i'm going to handle versioning.
